* overview of device
- This device is designed to run choice assays on honeybees automatically. Parameters are put into a file in the experiments folder and the user selects which experiment to start. Once started, python will generate a static schedule for group a and group b devices (A and B are the choices) and it will include training and testing bouts. A device controller will check the schedule and tell devices what to do. A tagger will tag the incoming data (using a model specified in the experiment) and save it to the database.

- dummy devices working, data tagger working for dummy devices
- next I have to add the schedule interpreter to send commands to the pheripheral devices. Also in plans: I need an analyzer to look at the schedule to determine if the cross is "correct"
